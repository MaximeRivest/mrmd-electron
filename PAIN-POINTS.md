# mrmd-electron Pain Points

Collected during usage. To be addressed later.

---

## 1. Commenting shortcuts are hard to discover/remember
- The keyboard shortcuts for commenting are not intuitive or easily learnable
- No obvious way to find them without already knowing them

## 2. AI command palette can go off-screen
- The palette sometimes renders outside the visible area
- Possible solutions: make it pinnable, or ensure it stays within viewport bounds
